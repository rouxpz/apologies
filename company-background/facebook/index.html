    <p>In the wake of the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook faced substantial criticism for its <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories">enabling of misinformation</a> and disinformation, its <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/21/facebook-white-nationalists-ban-vdare-red-ice">reluctance to monitor and block</a> the hate groups that were proliferating on the platform, and—most notably—the <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, which resulted in millions of users' data being shared for political ad targeting, without consent.
    <p>This criticism <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/technology/on-facebook-misinformation-is-more-popular-now-than-in-2016.html">only increased</a> during and after the 2020 election, most recently with Facebook being one of the primary tech platforms through which President Trump and his allies have pushed their <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-social-media/facebook-swamped-with-misinformation-extends-post-election-u-s-political-ad-ban-idUSKBN27R23Y">baseless claims of election fraud</a>, and on which numerous <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ignored-warnings-violent-anti-muslim-militia-hate-groups-2015-2020-9">hate groups and violent plots have taken shape</a>.</p>
    <p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has <a class="fbLink" href="https://apnews.com/article/c3291531831d19ff0eaf8d91aa1415a0">pointed to</a> nebulous notions of “free speech” and argued that it's <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/17/zuckerberg-standing-voice-free-expression/">not his place</a> to control what people post or share. But that line of thinking has already led to the platform being used as a tool of <a class="fbLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html">violence and genocide</a>, and does not acknowledge the vast influence it has over a huge portion of global Internet users today.</p>

    <h3>Facebook needs to take responsibility.</h3>
    <h3>Facebook should say sorry.</h3>
