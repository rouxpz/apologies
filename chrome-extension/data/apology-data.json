You mean a lot to us and we've just been terrified about the idea of you liking someone better. We should have trusted that you were with us for a reason, and not given ourselves excuses to call that into question. We promise that we will be a better search provider, and not go crazy like this again. We just really enjoy having you in our lives, and we get really sad when we think about that not being the case anymore.",

You trusted us, and we absolutely violated that trust. We understand if you don't want to use us again, but please know that we never meant for this to happen. We feel so bad about this and we would do anything to stay in your life as your web services provider.

We really need to take a step back and re-evaluate our priorities, because you don't deserve someone who doesn't respect or consider your feelings. We honestly feel like we are a bit in over our heads, and we didn't realize that our actions would have such huge consequences. We've been arrogant assholes and this may have been the reality check that we sorely needed. We definitely don't want to destroy democracy, and we're really scared that we already have. We will do whatever it takes to put the pieces back together again. We know it may not ever be the same, but we at least have to try.",

We weren't thinking about any of this when we first started out. Things got out of control so quickly, and we were too arrogant to think that we needed to be more critical and self-aware of our own decisions. We know that just saying sorry and sticking a Band-Aid over the problem will not fix anything; some of these decisions and views are so unconscious that we may not even know we have them (or maybe we're just in denial). These issues are embedded into the very core of our software, and we need to thoroughly examine the ways our systems our built in order to readjust our own priorities and think about how we may be actively harming the people who use our tools.",

We don't know where he got the idea that it was okay to say those things, and we need to understand why this happened before we can expect you to forgive us. If he felt okay saying those things to one person, there are bigger problems lying under the surface. This was a lapse in judgment that revealed a lot of worrying things about the way that we relate to the world, and we need to get to the bottom of this so that we can be a better company, and treat other people better, in the future.",
